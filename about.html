<p>Hi. I'm just a guy trying to find his way in the world. If I had to pick a few descriptors and categories for myself, I'd say I'm a soccer player, a ponderer, a wonderer, and a seeker. That and a whole bunch of -er's. And now I guess I'm trying to be a blogger! Hopefully, I can create some interesting content for any readers out there. My plan is to simply start building up a bunch of things which interest me, and allow a coherent them to somehow organically emerge....Yeah I don't know how it will happen either haha. Since I've been so kindly helped in this by the Flatiron School and Learn.co, there will probably be a solid portion dedicated to learning about development, programming, computer science, and technology in general. I wish to add a few other things in the future though, so for now let's just say the theme is life. Very broad and very vague. Good enough for a place holder until further notice....Enjoy!  >.<'</p>
